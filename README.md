haskell-mud
===========

Toy implementation of a MUD server in Haskell. Use stack to build/run.

## Why bother?

When I was a kid, I played a few MUDs. For quite a long time I played [JediMUD][jedimud]. It wasn't super famous, but I remember there were some nice people playing.

MUDs are a total anachronism now but used to be the closest thing to online worlds "back then". This is what makes them a perfect project to explore a new language. You have to deal with network, concurrency, game state, and so on. There's also no limit on complexity so you can explore various parts of the language you're learning. I'm not new to Haskell, but I've never used it for "real world" projects.

This is a toy in the sense that, it isn't meant to be "the best" implementation of a MUD in Haskell, but hopefully it ends up being interesting enough for someone to play. I plan not to look at other implementations. At least for a while.
