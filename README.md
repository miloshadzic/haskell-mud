haskell-mud
===========

Toy implementation of a MUD server in Haskell.

## Why bother?

When I was a kid, I played quite a few MUDs but most of all I played [JediMUD][jedimud]. It's also a perfect project to explore a new language since you have to deal with network and concurrency. You can make it as complex as you like.
